Introduction
.PP
After three years and around 35,000 km of service, two cracks were detected in the bike frame of an amateur cyclist. Bothcracks were located in the joint of the bottom bracket with the chain stays, the seat tube and the down tube, and were de-tected before the in-service failure of the component. The bike was used in the north coast of Spain, and therefore, in a humidclimate (average relative humidity around 80% over the year, precipitation of 1200‚1300 mm/year, and 150‚180 rainfalldays per year) with a saline environment.

shows the bike frame and the location of the cracks, whileFig. 2shows a detail of both cracks. It can be seen how thechain stays, the seat tube and the down tube are welded to the bottom bracket, generating a complex geometry with numer-ous weld beads.

, some indications of corrosion can be noticed in the interior of the bottom bracketand also in the vicinity of the cracks, in which the cyclist had performed a manual sanding, depriving these zones of the paintlayer.Fig. 3presents the cracked section containing Crack 1,\*([.3\*(.]

Chemical Analysis
.PP
Steel, aluminium alloys, titanium and carbon are the most used materials in bike frame fabrication. In the case being ana-lysed, it was known than the material was an aluminium alloy (AA), but the specific alloy was not known. The use of AAprovides light bike frames, with relatively simple fabrication processes, a wide variety of shapes and a significant stiffness provided by the high dimensions of the transversal sections used in the tubes.\*([.4\*(.]

Visual Inspection

As mentioned above,Fig. 2shows indications of corrosion in the interior of the bottom bracket and also in the vicinity ofthe two detected cracks. In order to establish the extension of the corrosion processes occurring in the bike frame, severalcuts were performed on it.Fig. 4shows the inner part of the joint between the bottom bracket, the seat tube and the downtube, with a widespread, clear and extended corrosion process occurring in the entire internal surface.\*([.5\*(.]
.lf 172 paper.ms
.PP
The rest of the cuts performed on the bike frame also revealed corrosion processes occurring all along the interior of theframe, in such a way that the closer to the bottom bracket, the more extended the corrosion process.Fig. 5shows the cor-rosion level found in some of the locations.Likewise,Fig. 6shows a hole found in the lower part of the bottom bracket. This hole provides an immediate access for theair, the water and the dirt to the interior of the tubes which, as shown inFig. 4, were connected through additional internalholes. The hole shown inFig. 6explains the images shown inFig. 5, given that the extension of the corrosion processes occur-ring on the different tubes depends on their corresponding proximity to the hole (that is, to the external environment).

EDX Results

.pdfhref L -D tab1 Table 1
shows the EDX results for the three different types of precipitates, confirming that they are all equilibrium (b) pre-cipitates with high order compositions. It can be observed that the so-called large dark precipitates have very high contentsof Si and Mg and lower contents of Al and Zn than AA 7005. The large bright precipitates have considerably high amounts ofSi and Mn, and a surprisingly high content of iron. Finally, the small precipitates have significant amounts of Si and Mn.Therefore, the three different types of precipitates distinguished through the SEM images effectively correspond to threeclearly different chemical compositions and their corresponding solution potentials. The table also gathers the chemicalcomposition of the weld material, confirming that it is an AA of the 5xxx series (Mg alloyed), as suggested in Section4.\*([.6, 1, 2\*(.]
